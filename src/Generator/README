Graph Coloring Generator Version 2
This is in most respects similar to Version 1.
See below for the principle difference.
See the generator page manual for the earlier version at
   http://web.cs.ualberta.ca/~joe/Coloring/Generators/manual.html

Hints on usage:

Different graph classes require different inputs. If you run this program
interactively then sufficient prompt hints will guide you to the required
inputs for the class of interest. It is then suggested that you use e.g. a
Perl script to generate the input file and run generator repeatedly for
batch runs.

...........
The primary difference between this and the earlier version is the
inclusion of code to generate evacuation graphs.  After the first or
hidden coloring is set, a complete k-partite graph is generated, with the
only independent sets being the elements of the hidden coloring. Then
the following:

Repeat 
   Generate a new partition of the vertices into k sets (deceptive coloring).
   For each of the k sets, 
       for every edge with both end points in the set
       delete it with probability 1-r, where r is the fraction to leave behind.
       (terminate loop if desired edge density achieved)
until desired edge density is achieved.

Note the last deceptive coloring may be partial.

The hidden and deceptive colorings are printed in file.dcp where the graph is
in file.
